In-class activity for Course STAT4060J in UM-JI, 2025 Fall

## Playlist
1. **rain** by mxmtoon;  
I first heard this song in the game Dave the Diver, and love its lighthearted tune and the sound of the acoustic guitar. (Yerui Huang)

2. **夜的盡頭(The End of Night)** by G.E.M.鄧紫棋;  
I first heard this song live at a concert—just like its title, *The End of Night* brings a burst of light at the end of the long night. **G.E.M.**'s voice and spirits helps turn the struggle into hope. (Zaixi Chen)
