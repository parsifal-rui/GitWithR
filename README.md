In-class activity for Course STAT4060J in UM-JI, 2025 Fall

## Playlist
1. **rain** by mxmtoon;  
I first heard this song in the game Dave the Diver, and love its lighthearted tune and the sound of the acoustic guitar. (Yerui Huang)

2. **cosmic love** by florence + the machine;   
I first heard this song from a Voltron AMV, a show with catastrophic effect on psyche and my first introduction to poorly written media because the characters had a lot of potential but fell flat, but the music and edits of the AMV made me feel that magic that I felt when watching the pilot.
