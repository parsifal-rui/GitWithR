## Playlist
1. **rain** by mxmtoon;  
I first heard this song in the game Dave the Diver, and love its lighthearted tune and the sound of the acoustic guitar. (Yerui Huang)

2. **After Hours** by TheWeeknd
I first discovered this song at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. What I really like about it is the unexpected shift in the beat. (Othmane Irhboula)
