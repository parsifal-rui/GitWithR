## Playlist
1. **rain** by mxmtoon;  
I first heard this song in the game Dave the Diver, and love its lighthearted tune and the sound of the acoustic guitar. (Yerui Huang)
2. **see you again** by Charlie Puth;
I first heard this song at the end of the movie Furious 7, and it always reminds me of the importance of friendship and cherishing the moments we have with our loved ones. (Zhecheng Liang)
