## Playlist
1. **rain** by mxmtoon;
I first heard this song in the game Dave the Diver, and love its lighthearted tune and the sound of the acoustic guitar. (Yerui Huang)

2. **Little Wish** by 塞壬唱片MSR;  
This's a Japanese song from the game Arknights. I love this song for its distinct style of Japan's Showa era, which differs from contemporary Japanese pop music. (Han Mingjia)
